                            that slightly slower, dimmer one I probably would've been a writer. Sat up in a corner trying to pen you into existence.
                            Not knowing you but still knowing I was missing something.

                        <p> Hello! I'm Shara Khoo, a current student in Republic Polytechnic persuing a diploma in Digital Design and Development. 
                            Through this diploma, I have picked up multiple skills such as coding with react, python, javascript, 
                            a little bit of C# from coding in unity, and MySQL. 
                            Alongside skills in using applications such as Tableau, PowerBI,  Illustrator, Figma and Webstorm.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>I also do digital drawings of my own as a side hobby, in which i have been drawing since 2018 and have grown my skills since then, 
                        I have worked alongside a video game company named MYTONA in which I drew their mascot for one of their video games, 
                        which is the first drawing in my digital art section.</p>

                    <p>As another side hobby, I am also a musician, having played the double bass for 4 years, during the years from 2018 to 2021 and 2023 to 2024.
                         I have participated in multiple concerts
                    </p>

                            <p>She peels an orange, separates it in perfect halves, and gives one of them to me.
                                If I could wear it like a friendship bracelet, I would. 
                                Instead I swallow it section by section and tell myself it means even more this way.
                                To chew and to swallow in silence with her. To taste the same thing in the same moment.
